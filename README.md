# Hacker News Search

A Full-Stack MERN web app exercising Redux and API integrations.
- Articles are pulled from the Hacker News API based on desired search term and results per page, with an option for filtering by recent trending (a.k.a Front Page) articles.
- Articles can then be saved, at which point they will display readers' comments (future release) and be kept out of future search results.
- Search terms are saved and presented to the user to provide a one-click search option.
